# Dropvine Markets

## Local setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the dedicated Dropvine Markets Supabase project values:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are safe for public browser reads.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is server-only and must never be exposed to client code.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` protects `/admin` with a signed, `httpOnly` cookie.

Apply `supabase/migrations/20260904000000_create_markets_schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor or with the Supabase CLI. The migration enables RLS on every table and grants anonymous reads only for published markets and their related dates, vendors, and links.

Open `http://localhost:3000/admin` to sign in to the admin area.
